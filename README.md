# Mem0 eve template

An [eve](https://eve.dev) agent template with long-term memory powered by
[Mem0](https://mem0.ai). eve is Vercel's framework for durable backend AI agents;
this template wires Mem0 into an eve agent so it remembers facts and preferences
about each user across conversations, getting more helpful over time instead of
starting from scratch.

## Deploy

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https://github.com/mem0ai/mem0-eve-template&project-name=mem0-eve-template&repository-name=mem0-eve-template&integration-ids=oac_rTG82TypBWqzWTr1IpOUG7EB)

Deploy clones this repo and installs the Mem0 integration, which sets `MEM0_API_KEY`
on your project automatically. Model access uses the Vercel AI Gateway through your
linked project.

## How it works

The agent has two Mem0-backed tools:

- **`remember`** — saves a durable fact or preference (`mem0.add`).
- **`recall_memories`** — searches long-term memory for relevant facts (`mem0.search`).

The instructions (`agent/instructions.md`) tell the model to recall before answering
and to remember durable facts. Memory is scoped per user via
`ctx.session.auth.current.principalId` (see `agent/lib/mem0.ts`).

## Auth

Out of the box the chat channel is a public demo (`none()` in
`agent/channels/eve.ts`): anyone with the deployment URL can chat, and the
deployment itself is gated by Vercel deployment protection. Before exposing the
agent for real, swap `none()` for a real provider (Auth.js, Clerk,
`vercelOidc()`). Memory is scoped per authenticated user via `principalId`, so a
real provider gives each user their own memory automatically.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
vercel env pull            # pulls MEM0_API_KEY from your Vercel project
# set AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY, or link a Vercel project for model access
npm run dev                # opens the eve development REPL
```

Try it: tell the agent something ("I'm vegetarian and allergic to nuts"), start a
new session, and ask "what can I eat?" — it recalls what you told it.
